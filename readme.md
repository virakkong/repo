Hello My name is Virak Kong
=======================================

###My Backgorund:

> My background is very long. I would like to introduce myself briefly. I currently graduated from an engineering program at a local university of the state of Washington. I currently postpone my work in a local company to pursue web development. I still keep my part-time job. My goal of education at Bloc is to gain industrial knowledge  in web development from software engineering mentor. 

> The reasons that I chose Bloc over other bootcamps is that Bloc bassically provide one-on-one mentorship (apparenticeship). This allow me to ask questions and get feedback and critics my works. Second, the carreer support from day 0. 

> I hope that  I could get a very fruitable experiences with Bloc and its community. I believe that with my well-educated mentor, I can be a good software engineer.
