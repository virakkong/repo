Hello My name is Virak Kong
=======================================

###My Backgorund:

> My background is very long. I would like to introduce myself briefly. I currently graduated from an engineering program at a local university of the state of Washington. I currently postpone my work in a local company to pursue web development. My goal of education at Bloc is to gain industrial knowledge  in web development from software engineering mentor. 

> The reasons that I chose Bloc over other bootcamps is that Bloc bassically provide one-on-one mentorship (apparenticeship). This allows me to ask questions and get feedback and critic on my works. Second, the carreer support starts from day 0. 

###The followings are my goals at Bloc:

1. Gain expeiennces with Industrial mentorship
2. Gain resourceful knowledge in Bloc community
3. Gain knowledge in writing codes professionally ( The right directions), not from traditional classroom (peer review, discussion boards, etc.)
4. Gain expriences in job searches and build professonal portfolio and projects (apps).
5. Get hired as a software engineer (**Amazon**, Google, Microsoft).



I hope that  I could get a very fruitable experiences with Bloc and its community. I believe that with help from my well-educated mentor, I can be a good software engineer. Hello Michael! I cannot wait to see you.

That is what Javascript look like 
```
function test (arr) {
console.log("Hello World");
}
```
#Using 4 spaces:
    function min (arr) {
       int min = arr[0];
       for(var i=0; i<arr.length; i++)
        {
         #code only no H1
        }
      Console.log("Test");
    }
